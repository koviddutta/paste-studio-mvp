Project Name: Paste Studio MVP – Indian Sweets Paste Formulation Engine
What It Does
– Uses 1000+ Indian sweet recipes from Supabase
– Classifies each ingredient into 6 processing classes (Dairy, Nut, Sugar & Binders, Fat, Stabilizer, Aromatic)
– Generates a detailed step-by-step production SOP (up to ~40 steps)
– Calculates key properties (water activity, estimated shelf-life, viscosity, dosage for gelato base)
– Runs basic safety checks (pasteurisation steps, water activity range, typical sugar/fat limits)
– Outputs a full formulation + downloadable PDF SOP

**Tech Stack**:
- Backend: Python 3.9+ + FastAPI
- Frontend: Reflex (React-based)
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Storage: Supabase or MinIO
- Deployment: Reflex Cloud

**Timeline**: 4 weeks to MVP
